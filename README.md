**Conclusions**:

1)The Casual users have leisure rides mostly on weekends and with longer ride lengths.

2)The Annual users have commute rides, during all week using with shorter ride lengths.


**Top 3 recommendations based on analysis**

1) Offer a weekend membership in order to motivate casual users towards a full annual membership. 
2) Implement campaings in the summer period, when the number of casual rides is higher
3) Since ride length for casual is considerably higher, the app could notify the riders that buying an annual membership could save them money on longer duration trips.
